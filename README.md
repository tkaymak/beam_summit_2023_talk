## Before you begin

Make sure you have a [Python 3](https://www.python.org/) development environment ready.
If you don't, you can download and install it from the
[Python downloads page](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

```sh
# Create a new Python virtual environment.
python -m venv env

# Activate the virtual environment.
source env/bin/activate
```

Install the project's dependencies from the [`requirements.txt`](requirements.txt) file.

```py
pip install -U pip

# Install the project as a local package, this installs all the dependencies as well.
pip install -e .
```

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è Once you are done, you can run the `deactivate` command to go back to your global Python installation.

### Running the pipeline

Running your pipeline in Python is as easy as running the script file directly.

```sh
# You can run the script file directly.
python main.py

# To run passing command line arguments.
python main.py --input-text="üéâ"

# To run the tests.
python -m unittest -v
```

## GitHub Actions automated testing

This project already comes with automated testing via [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions).

To configure it, look at the [`.github/workflows/test.yaml`](.github/workflows/test.yaml) file.

## Using other runners

To keep this template small, it only includes the [Direct Runner](https://beam.apache.org/documentation/runners/direct/).

For a comparison of what each runner currently supports, look at the [Beam Capability Matrix](https://beam.apache.org/documentation/runners/capability-matrix/).

To add a new runner, visit the runner's page for instructions on how to include it.
