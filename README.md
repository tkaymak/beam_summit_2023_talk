## Before you begin

Make sure you have a [Python 3](https://www.python.org/) development environment ready.
If you don't, you can download and install it from the
[Python downloads page](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

```sh
# Create a new Python virtual environment.
python -m venv env

# Activate the virtual environment.
source env/bin/activate
```

Install the project's dependencies from the [`requirements.txt`](requirements.txt) file.

```py
pip install -U pip

# Install the project as a local package, this installs all the dependencies as well.
pip install -e .
```

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è Once you are done, you can run the `deactivate` command to go back to your global Python installation.

### Running the pipeline

Running your pipeline in Python is as easy as running the tests directly.

```sh
# To run the pipeline as a Testpipeline and experience how it works through the logs.
python -m unittest -v

# To run passing command line arguments (these are ignored in the app.py right now).
python main.py --lookup_input_topic="üéâ" --core_input_topic="üéâ"


```
